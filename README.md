## Overview

With Wagtail as the backend, and a separate app for the front-end (for example a single page React app), editors are no
longer able to preview their changes. This is because the front-end is no longer within Wagtail's direct control.
The preview data therefore needs to be exposed to the front-end app.

This package enables previews for Wagtail pages when used in a headless setup by routing the preview to the specified
front-end URL.

## Setup

Install using pip:
```sh
pip install wagtail-headless-preview
```

After installing the module, add `wagtail_headless_preview` to installed apps in your settings file:

```python
# settings.py

INSTALLED_APPS = [
    # ...
    "wagtail_headless_preview",
]
```

Run migrations:

```sh
$ python manage.py migrate
```

Then configure the preview client URL using the `CLIENT_URLS` option in the `WAGTAIL_HEADLESS_PREVIEW` setting.

## Configuration

`wagtail_headless_preview` uses a single settings dictionary:

```python
# settings.py

WAGTAIL_HEADLESS_PREVIEW = {
    "CLIENT_URLS": {},  # defaults to an empty dict. You must at the very least define the default client URL.
    "SERVE_BASE_URL": None,  # can be used for HeadlessServeMixin
    "REDIRECT_ON_PREVIEW": False,  # set to True to redirect to the preview instead of using the Wagtail default mechanism
    "ENFORCE_TRAILING_SLASH": True,  # set to False in order to disable the trailing slash enforcement
}
```

### Single site setup

For single sites, add the front-end URL as the default entry:

```python
WAGTAIL_HEADLESS_PREVIEW = {
    "CLIENT_URLS": {
        "default": "http://localhost:8020",
    }
}
```

If you have configured your Wagtail `Site` entry to use the front-end URL, then you can update your configuration to:

```python
WAGTAIL_HEADLESS_PREVIEW = {
    "CLIENT_URLS": {
        "default": "{SITE_ROOT_URL}",
    }
}
```

The `{SITE_ROOT_URL}` placeholder is replaced with the `root_url` property of the `Site` the preview page belongs to.


### Multi-site setup

For a multi-site setup, add each site as a separate entry in the `CLIENT_URLS` option in the `WAGTAIL_HEADLESS_PREVIEW` setting:

```python
WAGTAIL_HEADLESS_PREVIEW = {
    "CLIENT_URLS": {
        "default": "https://wagtail.org",  # adjust to match your front-end URL. e.g. locally it may be something like http://localhost:8020
        "cms.wagtail.org": "https://wagtail.org",
        "cms.torchbox.com": "http://torchbox.com",
    },
    # ...
}
```

### Serve URL

To make the editing experience seamles and to avoid server errors due to missing templates,
you can use the `HeadlessMixin` which combines the `HeadlessServeMixin` and `HeadlessPreviewMixin` mixins.

`HeadlessServeMixin` overrides the Wagtail `Page.serve` method to redirect to the client URL. By default,
it uses the hosts defined in `CLIENT_URLS`. However, you can provide a single URL to rule them all:

```python
# settings.py

WAGTAIL_HEADLESS_PREVIEW = {
    # ...
    "SERVE_BASE_URL": "https://my.headless.site",
}
```

### Enforce trailing slash

By default, `wagtail_headless_preview` enforces a trailing slash on the client URL. You can disable this behaviour by
setting `ENFORCE_TRAILING_SLASH` to `False`:

```python
# settings.py
WAGTAIL_HEADLESS_PREVIEW = {
    # ...
    "ENFORCE_TRAILING_SLASH": False
}
```

## Usage

To enable preview as well as wire in the "View live" button in the Wagtail UI, add the `HeadlessMixin`
to your `Page` class:

```python
from wagtail.models import Page
from wagtail_headless_preview.models import HeadlessMixin


class MyWonderfulPage(HeadlessMixin, Page):
    pass
```

If you require more granular control, or if you've modified you `Page` model's `serve` method, you can
add `HeadlessPreviewMixin` to your `Page` class to only handle previews:

```python
from wagtail.models import Page
from wagtail_headless_preview.models import HeadlessPreviewMixin


class MyWonderfulPage(HeadlessPreviewMixin, Page):
    pass
```

## How will my front-end app display preview content?

This depends on your project, as it will be dictated by the requirements of your front-end app.

The following example uses a Wagtail API endpoint to access previews -
your app may opt to access page previews using [GraphQL](https://wagtail.io/blog/getting-started-with-wagtail-and-graphql/) instead.

### Example

This example sets up an API endpoint which will return the preview for a page, and then displays that data
on a simplified demo front-end app.

* Add `wagtail.api.v2` to the installed apps:
```python
# settings.py

INSTALLED_APPS = [
    # ...
    "wagtail.api.v2",
]
```

* create an `api.py` file in your project directory:

```python
from django.contrib.contenttypes.models import ContentType

from wagtail.api.v2.router import WagtailAPIRouter
from wagtail.api.v2.views import PagesAPIViewSet

from wagtail_headless_preview.models import PagePreview
from rest_framework.response import Response


# Create the router. "wagtailapi" is the URL namespace
api_router = WagtailAPIRouter("wagtailapi")


class PagePreviewAPIViewSet(PagesAPIViewSet):
    known_query_parameters = PagesAPIViewSet.known_query_parameters.union(
        ["content_type", "token"]
    )

    def listing_view(self, request):
        page = self.get_object()
        serializer = self.get_serializer(page)
        return Response(serializer.data)

    def detail_view(self, request, pk):
        page = self.get_object()
        serializer = self.get_serializer(page)
        return Response(serializer.data)

    def get_object(self):
        app_label, model = self.request.GET["content_type"].split(".")
        content_type = ContentType.objects.get(app_label=app_label, model=model)

        page_preview = PagePreview.objects.get(
            content_type=content_type, token=self.request.GET["token"]
        )
        page = page_preview.as_page()
        if not page.pk:
            # fake primary key to stop API URL routing from complaining
            page.pk = 0

        return page


api_router.register_endpoint("page_preview", PagePreviewAPIViewSet)
```

* Register the API URLs so Django can route requests into the API:

```python
# urls.py

from .api import api_router

urlpatterns = [
    # ...
    path("api/v2/", api_router.urls),
    # ...
    # Ensure that the api_router line appears above the default Wagtail page serving route
    path("", include(wagtail_urls)),
]
```

For further information about configuring the wagtail API, refer to the [Wagtail API v2 Configuration Guide](https://docs.wagtail.io/en/stable/advanced_topics/api/v2/configuration.html)

* Next, add a `client/index.html` file in your project root. This will query the API to display our preview:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <script>
        function go() {
            var querystring = window.location.search.replace(/^\?/, '');
            var params = {};
            querystring.replace(/([^=&]+)=([^&]*)/g, function(m, key, value) {
                params[decodeURIComponent(key)] = decodeURIComponent(value);
            });

            var apiUrl = 'http://localhost:8000/api/v2/page_preview/1/?content_type=' + encodeURIComponent(params['content_type']) + '&token=' + encodeURIComponent(params['token']) + '&format=json';
            fetch(apiUrl).then(function(response) {
                response.text().then(function(text) {
                    document.body.innerText = text;
                });
            });
        }
    </script>
</head>
<body onload="go()"></body>
</html>
```


* Install [django-cors-headers](https://pypi.org/project/django-cors-headers/): `pip install django-cors-headers`
* Add CORS config to your settings file to allow the front-end to access the API

```python
# settings.py
CORS_ORIGIN_ALLOW_ALL = True
CORS_URLS_REGEX = r"^/api/v2/"
```

and follow the rest of the [setup instructions for django-cors-headers](https://github.com/ottoyiu/django-cors-headers#setup).

* Start up your site as normal: `python manage.py runserver 0:8000`
* Serve the front-end `client/index.html` at `http://localhost:8020/`
   - this can be done by running `python3 -m http.server 8020` from inside the client directory
* From the wagtail admin interface, edit (or create) and preview a page that uses `HeadlessPreviewMixin`

The preview page should now show you the API response for the preview! ðŸŽ‰

This is where a real front-end would take over and display the preview as it would be seen on the live site.

## [0.2] - 2022-01-30

This release adds a number of useful features such as a default client URL placeholder,
ability to redirect to the front-end URLs when viewing a page in the Wagtail admin, and
an option to redirect the preview to the client URL rather than use the default iframe embed mechanism.

It also moves to a single, namespaced settings dictionary - `WAGTAIL_HEADLESS_PREVIEW`:

```python
WAGTAIL_HEADLESS_PREVIEW = {
    "CLIENT_URLS": {},  # previously HEADLESS_PREVIEW_CLIENTS_URLS
    "LIVE_PREVIEW": False,  # previously HEADLESS_PREVIEW_LIVE
    "SERVE_BASE_URL": None,  # new optional setting for HeadlessServeMixin / HeadlessMixin
    "REDIRECT_ON_PREVIEW": False,  # new optional setting to redirect the preview to the client preview URL
}
```
